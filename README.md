# Inverse Dog Challenge

This repo has three parts:

## Server

This is the C# source code of the challenge server, it is poorly written because I had like 10 minutes to make it...

## Game

The game itself, install GameMaker: Studio 1.4 to open the project file.

## Website

The `http://inversedog.ddns.net/` website. (now defunct)

Have fun!
